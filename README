WARNING: THIS IS NOT MY PROJECT, NOR IS IT ACTIVELY DEVELOPED.

It is a mirror of a seemingly extinct project at http://www.mdevan.org/llvm-py, with an additional patch (from the author) applied to build against LLVM 2.9. It is known to be broken/flakey, and is only kept here for archival purposes since it is newer than the latest trunk in the official repository.


llvm-py: Python Bindings for LLVM
---------------------------------

llvm-py provides Python bindings for LLVM.

Versions:
---------
    This package will work only with LLVM 2.9, and Python 2.4 or later,
    (not Python 3.x).


Quickstart:
-----------
    1. Get 2.9 version of LLVM, build it. Make sure '--enable-pic' is
       passed to LLVM's 'configure'.

    2. Get llvm-py and install it:

        # To build and install:
        $ cd llvm-py
        # Locate llvm-config, usually under <llvm>/Release/bin
        $ python setup.py install --user --llvm-config=/path/to/llvm-config

    3. See documentation at 'www/web/index.html' and examples under 'test'.


LICENSE:
--------
    llvm-py is distributed under the new BSD license, which is similar to
    the LLVM license itself. See the file called LICENSE for the full 
    license text.
